                       </div>
                       <p class="text">Paragliding is an adventurous recreational sport that involves flying through the air using a paraglider, which is a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing, which is inflated by running or launching off a cliff or hillside. Once in the air, the pilot uses wind currents and thermals to stay aloft and control their flight path. Paragliding provides an exhilarating experience of flying like a bird and enjoying stunning views of the surrounding landscapes.</p>

It is a popular sport around the world, with many dedicated paragliding schools, clubs, and competitions. While it can be a risky activity, with proper training and adherence to safety guidelines, paragliding can be a thrilling and rewarding experience that allows individuals to explore new heights and gain a unique perspective on the world.</p>
